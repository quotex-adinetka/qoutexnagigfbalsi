# Quotex Candlestick Pattern PDF: Your Path to Trading Mastery

## What is a Candlestick Pattern?

A candlestick pattern is a graphical representation of price action over
a specific period, typically a day, week, or month. It consists of a
body, which represents the difference between the open and close prices,
and wicks, which indicate the highest and lowest prices reached within
that period.
